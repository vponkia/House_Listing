outline for a House Listing system that 
uses Node.js, Express.js, EJS, sessions and cookies, Mongoose, and React.

npm init -y

npm install nodejs nodemon express bodyParser session cookies mongoose ejs

**1. Planning and Design**
Before starting with the development, the first step is to define the features of the project,
 the database schema, and the overall architecture of the application.

- **Features:**

  - User Registration and Login
  - Add/Update/Delete houses (for registered users)
  - Search and View house listings
  - Contact the house owner

- **Database Schema:**

  - Users: {userID, email, password, name}
  - Houses: {houseID, title, description, price, location, photos, userID}
  - Sessions: {sessionID, userID, expireTime}

   

**2. Backend Development**
Start by setting up your Node.js and Express.js server.
- **Database Connection**: Use Mongoose to connect your application with MongoDB.
- **User Registration and Login**: Create these routes using Express. Save the data into MongoDB using Mongoose. Passwords should be hashed before being saved. You can use libraries like bcrypt for this.
- **Sessions**: Use express-session for handling sessions.
     Whenever a user logs in, create a new session.

- **House Listing**: Create routes to add, update, delete and view house listings. 
All these routes should be protected i.e., only authenticated users can access these routes.

- **Search Functionality**: Create a route that gets the house based on search parameters.

- **APIs**: Create REST APIs to perform CRUD operations.


**3. Frontend Development**
You can start the frontend development parallelly using EJS and React.
- **Landing Page**: The landing page will display a list of all the house listings.
- **Sign Up and Sign In Page**: These pages will be used for user registration and login.
- **Dashboard**: If the user is authenticated, they can add, update or delete their house listings from the dashboard.
- **House Page**: If a user clicks on a house from the landing page, they can view more
 details about the house. If the user is the owner of the house, they should have options to 
 update or delete the house.
- **Search**: There should be a search feature on the landing page where users can search for houses based on location, price, etc.


**4. Security**
- **Password Hashing**: As mentioned earlier, always hash the passwords before saving them to the database.
- **Authentication and Authorization**: Protect the routes that should only be accessible by the \
authenticated users. You can use middleware to check if a user is authenticated before they 
access certain routes.
- **Validation**: Validate all the user inputs before using them in your application or storing them in your database. You can use libraries like Joi for this.


**5. Code Refactoring**
Refactor your code regularly to keep it clean and maintainable. Some practices to follow are:

- Use meaningful names for your variables, functions, and classes.
- Keep your functions short and make sure each function does only one thing.
- Avoid duplicating code.
- Use comments to describe what your code does.



**6. Testing**
Write unit tests and integration tests for your application. 
This will ensure that your application works as expected even after you 
make changes to your code in the future.



**7. Deployment**

Finally, deploy your application. You can use platforms like Heroku 
or AWS for deploying your application.
This is a basic outline for your project. 
As you build it, you will probably need to add more features and 
make some adjustments to this plan. Good luck with your project!
